# House-prices-predicitions
This project is for neural network implementation for the kaggle dataset-->https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques.
housing-model.py is a neural network with 3 hidden layers and housing-model2.py is a neural network with 5 hidden layers.
housing-model3.py and housing-model4.py are better neural networks using leaky relu as activation function and isolation forest for removing outliers.
